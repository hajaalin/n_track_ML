example_images
    imgs to be used for tracking, OME-TIFF

data_tabular
    * dataset for ML, csv

scripts
    * tracking (serumconc from filename) + aggregate()
    - data_preprocessing (feature engineering)
    baseline
    GBC (+ SHAP, should everything be packed in functions?)
    MLP (basic)
    InceptionTime (will it be directory?)

temp_readme (to be removed when shared)
readme
requirements (or do we need it if scripts packed properly?)

=============================================================================

label (serum concentration) is extracted from filename for simplicity.
No manual step inbetween analyse_data() and aggregate()
